Analysing the Time complexity in quick sort
considering two arrays for comparision
array 1
[9, -3, 5, 2, 6, 8, -6, 1, 3]
array 2 
[9, -3, 5, 2, 6, 8, -6]
time taken to sort array 1 is 0.746 milliseconds
time taken to sort array 2 is 0.869 milliseconds

The splitting of a array of elements is in any ratio, not necessarily divided into half.	
In the merge sort, the array is parted into just 2 halves (i.e. n/2).

Worst case complexity	O(n^2)	
Average case complexity	O(n log n)

Works well on	
quick sort It works well on smaller array	
merge sort It operates fine on any size of array

Speed of execution	
quick sort It work faster than other sorting algorithms for small data set like Selection sort etc	
merge sort It has a consistent speed on any size of data

Additional storage space requirement	
quick sort requires Less space	
merge sort requires More space

Efficiency	
quick sort Inefficient for larger arrays	
merge sort More efficient

Sorting method	
quick sort Internal	
merge sort External

Stability	
quick sort Not Stable Preferred for Arrays	
merge sort Stable for Preferred Linked Lists
